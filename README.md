# Career_Advisor
Suggests top 5 career insights 
The Career Advisor project is a machine learning-based application designed to assist students in making informed decisions about their future career paths. Leveraging predictive analytics, the project analyzes various factors such as academic performance in major subjects, absenteeism, and participation in extracurricular activities to recommend suitable career options.
The project utilizes Jupyter for the backend machine learning model development and Streamlit for the frontend user interface, all integrated within the Anaconda Navigator environment.
1.Predicts the top 5 career options based on input academic scores, absenteeism, and extracurricular activities.

2.Built using Python with Jupyter for model training and Streamlit for interactive frontend.

3.Easy to use interface with intuitive controls for inputting data.

4.Provides insightful career recommendations for students based on their academic performance and activities.

5.Utilizes Anaconda Navigator for streamlined environment management.


**Key Features:**

Career Prediction: The core functionality of the project involves predicting the top 5 career options for a given student based on their academic scores, attendance record, and extracurricular involvement.

Machine Learning Model: Behind the scenes, the project utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of historical academic and career data. The model learns patterns and correlations between academic performance and career choices to provide accurate predictions.

User-Friendly Interface: The project offers an intuitive user interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to easily input their academic scores, absenteeism, and extracurricular activities and receive instant career recommendations.
